# AdvancedHomeworkManager

Chrome Extension Homework manager. Originally completed in February as a console application. I am currently remaking it into a Chrome Extension.

Changes: 
 - Priority now done using a Priority Tree ADT, for faster asymptotic run times
 - Frontend GUI redone using Grid Layout instead of BootStrap Framework, massively increasing readability and decreasing bundle size
 - Backend being rewritten using JavaScript + Chrome Storage API as a database and persistence.
